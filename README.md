at De La Salle University.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/wendellabino07/linearModellingLaptops">Regression Analysis on Laptops Using Linear Modelling</a></h3>
        <p>
            With Mr. Remus Guderian Yap, we were tasked to do a regression analysis on whatever dataset that we can think of. Eventually,
            we landed on laptop prices datasets. Through the use of linear modelling and other concepts taught in class, we analyzed which
            properties of a laptop affect the price. Through carefully setting up the predictors and the price (what is being predicted),
            we were able to get insights on what properties of the laptop that we should look out for. For full details, check out
            the project's video presentation through this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhJ7f54lfb4.

        <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N_bCNgg0Kc">What is Tesselation in Computer Graphics?</a></h3>
        <p>
            The final project in Mathematics in the Modern World course (GEMATMW), we were required to create a video about Mathematics 
            applications in the present world. My video is about tesselation, but an application to computer graphics. Tesselation in
            computer graphics is a fundamental process involving breaking down complex surfaces or models into smaller bits of geometric
            shapes, polygons or triangles. With the help of this technique, it enhances the efficiency and "realisticness" of the figures
            in video games or CGI movies. The smaller shapes allow graphics to have finer detail and smoother curves, especially in 3D
            modelling. With the utilization of tesellation, modern graphics can replicate lifelike textrues, grass, any terrains, detailed
            objects, anything that represents real world objects are enhanced significantly, improving visual quality and immersion in
            virtual reality, simulations, movies, and games. For more details, check out the video I made by clicking on the title of this
            section.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/wendellabino07/portfolio/blob/main/Papers/CSALGCM_N01_AbinoYap.pdf">Banach-Mazur Game</a></h3>
        <p>
            The Banach-Mazur game is a complex mathematical game used in topology that explores properties of spaces, like Baire category or
            completeness. I was a small contributor of this paper, this is mainly done by Mr. Remus Guderian Yap when we were tasked to analyze
            and create a paper about algorithms. It starts with two players, Player A and Player B who take turns choosing nested subsets of a 
            topological space. Player A starts with a set, and Player B responds with picking a subset of Player A's choice where Player B's choice 
            of a subset must be completely contained in Player A's set, and so on. To check out the paper, click the title of this section.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/wendellabino07/personalDashboard">Personal Dashboard</a></h3>
        <p>
            This personal dashboard of mine summarizes what I want to happen in the future. I am interested in going overseas to explore more 
            opportunities about data related jobs. I have seen and briefly read about those jobs, and I want to explore them. In this personal 
            dashboard, it includes my profile, almost everything about my college credentials, and a brief introduction explain why I chose 
            the dataset of data related jobs. Apart from that, there is a map graph there connected with the two other subgraphs below that
            could give insights about what job openings there should I pursue. To see the dashboard itself, check out the respository by clicking
            the title of this section.
