        <h3><a href="https://github.com/wendellabino07/linearModellingLaptops">Regression Analysis on Laptops Using Linear Modelling</a></h3>
        <p>
            With Mr. Remus Guderian Yap, we were tasked to do a regression analysis on whatever dataset that we can think of. Eventually,
            we landed on laptop prices datasets. Through the use of linear modelling and other concepts taught in class, we analyzed which
            properties of a laptop affect the price. Through carefully setting up the predictors and the price (what is being predicted),
            we were able to get insights on what properties of the laptop that we should look out for. For full details, check out
            the project's video presentation through this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhJ7f54lfb4.

        <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N_bCNgg0Kc">What is Tesselation in Computer Graphics?</a></h3>
        <p>
            The final project in Mathematics in the Modern World course (GEMATMW), we were required to create a video about Mathematics 
            applications in the present world. My video is about tesselation, but an application to computer graphics. Tesselation in
            computer graphics is a fundamental process involving breaking down complex surfaces or models into smaller bits of geometric
            shapes, polygons or triangles. With the help of this technique, it enhances the efficiency and "realisticness" of the figures
            in video games or CGI movies. The smaller shapes allow graphics to have finer detail and smoother curves, especially in 3D
            modelling. With the utilization of tesellation, modern graphics can replicate lifelike textrues, grass, any terrains, detailed
            objects, anything that represents real world objects are enhanced significantly, improving visual quality and immersion in
            virtual reality, simulations, movies, and games. For more details, check out the video I made by clicking on the title of this
            section.
